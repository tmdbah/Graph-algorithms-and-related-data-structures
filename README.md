# Graph-algorithms-and-related-data-structures

In this project we will implement, test &amp; analyze: Single-source Shortest Path, Minimum Spanning Tree &amp; finding Strongly Connected components algorithms.

This ReadMe is a guide on how to run the three problems in Project 2 of Algorithms and Data Structures.
This project contains following files:

•	Problem1.zip
•	Google Colab link for Problem 2
•	Text file to be taken as input for problem 2
•	Problem3.zip
•	Final Report
•	This ReadMe

Problem 1:
This code tests 4 different test cases. The test cases are written inside the code. To run it, simply run the Main file. This code is in Java. It can take input from a text file as well, and that part of the code is commented out in the Main section of the code

Problem 2:
This code takes input from a text file. This text file is named Project2_Input.txt. All modifications can be made inside this text file. The four different test cases have been elaborated in the report pdf submitted as part of this project. To run it, refer the Google Colab link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xisv6gJnJLlwvJzfCa5dp8LPdL3HDBCl
Import the text file in the Google Colab runtime by going to File->Upload. Then simply run the code.
This code is written using Python

Problem 3:
This code tests 4 different test cases. The test cases are written inside the code. To run it, simply run the Main file. This code is in Java. It can take input from a text file as well, and that part of the code is commented out in the Main section of the code
